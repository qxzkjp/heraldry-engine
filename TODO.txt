Favourite problems:
*implement strewn charges (syntax+rendering)
*implement arrangements (rendering)
*implement charges on ordinaries (rendering)
	Done pale, fess and bends. Do more complex ordinaries as implemented.
	single charges on bends should be in honour point

(PROBLEM BLAZONS)
Azure, three fleurs-de-lys Or (on the oval shield)
	top two carges are worryingly asymmetric
per pale gules a bend or and azure a billet argent
	billet too close to border
Per pale Azure on a bend between two mullets Or three roundels Vert and Argent three phrygian caps Gules
	Does not draw on oval shield in Firefox!

	
(RENDERING)
*re-do rendering code to be more recursive
*re-do rendering code to not rely on actually drawing SVG elements
(UI)
*investigate button text sizing
(RENDERING)
*fix furs on bends (ermines)
	do this by implementing strewn charges (sem√© of...)
*change charge drawing code to do arrangements
	in particular, draw charges either side of a bend slightly more consistently
*implement charge groups
* implement geometric charges: annulet
	implement cross couped; this requires implementing the syntax of the word "couped"
(SYNTAX)
*implement secondary charges
	allow a second ordanary to be plainly stated
		eg "Azure, a bend or on a chief argent three mullets gules"
	allow secondary moveables to be introduced with prepositions (above, beside, etc)
	allow moveable to be introduced with positions
		eg "Vert, in chief a mullet or, in base a fleur-de-lys argent"
*implement armed, langued, attired, unguled

*implement at least one beast (preferably lion)
